## Wordpress on Docker
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. This is only a simple case to install wordpress on docker.

Please make sure you already install Docker on your local machine before try this module. If you still not have installed it, you can check how to install Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

**Notes**
The docker volumes db_data and wordpress_data persists updates made by WordPress to the database, as well as the installed themes and plugins. Learn more about docker volumes.
